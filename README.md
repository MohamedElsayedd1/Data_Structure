# Data Structure Implementations in C

This repository provides comprehensive implementations of essential data structures using C. Each data structure is designed with a focus on efficiency and clarity, making it suitable for educational purposes and practical applications in software development. The following data structures are included:

### 1. **Stack (LIFO)**
   - Implemented using both arrays and linked lists, showcasing basic stack operations like `push()`, `pop()`, `peek()`, and stack traversal. This structure follows Last-In-First-Out behavior and is ideal for tasks like expression evaluation, backtracking, and undo operations.

### 2. **Queue (FIFO)**
   - A linear data structure demonstrating First-In-First-Out behavior, with both array-based and linked list-based implementations. The queue supports operations such as `enqueue()`, `dequeue()`, `front()`, and `rear()`. This is expanded to include circular queues, enabling efficient memory utilization.

### 3. **Linked Lists**
   - **Singly Linked List**: Efficiently handles dynamic memory allocation and supports insertion, deletion, and traversal operations. 
   - **Doubly Linked List**: Allows bidirectional traversal and adds flexibility for operations such as node deletion from both ends.


Each data structure includes a set of example use cases to demonstrate practical applications, and the code is well-documented for easier understanding. This repository is a great resource for anyone learning data structures or looking to refresh their knowledge with C++ implementations.
